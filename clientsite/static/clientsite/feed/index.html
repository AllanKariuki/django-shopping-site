										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cybercrimes are increasing at an alarming rate. Internet users are now more vulnerable. This is the time to be very careful and suspicious of everything and anyone you interact with online. I don’t mean that you become paranoid, I am just saying that you should be extra cautious for you to be safe online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the news, there are reports of bank frauds, data leaks, and inappropriate photos of people leaked online every now and then. Online crooks are swift and persistent. They are very patient and are always waiting for you to let your guard down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is high time you took your online security more seriously just as you avoid visiting dangerous neighborhoods and streets.</p>



<p>Here are a few tips to help you protect yourself online and offline.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Limit the Amount of Personal Information you Share</strong></li></ol>



<p>Oversharing your information be it location, personal dramas, private photos and videos, children, emotions, and your every move makes you a prime target. The sad thing is that not only hackers are dangerous; a colleague, an ex, or a nosy neighbor can as well make your life online a living hell.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep in mind that everything you post online has the potential of reaching millions of people around the world. This information also stays online for good. With technology changing every day, who knows what scammers and hackers will do with all the information you share.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Make Use of your Browser and Mobile Operating Systems Security Features</strong></li></ol>



<p>Social media sites and marketers make money through your personal information. The more they know about you, the more money they make. They do not care whether you want it shared or not. So long as it is available, they leverage it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, these browsers and sites have privacy options that are often hard to find.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meticulously check for privacy settings in both web browsers and mobile operating systems. Look for the privacy settings before doing or posting anything and enable them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You could also use browsers, such as <a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brave</a>, that protect you from online trackers and bots.</p>



<ol start="3"><li>&nbsp;<strong>Update your Devices and Internet Browsers</strong></li></ol>



<p>Because hackers and scammers are tech-savvy and ever on the lookout, devices and browsers offer regular updates to keep users protected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pop-up that usually comes up asking you to update your computer, mobile, or software is annoying, right? As annoying as it may be, please do not ignore it. It is for your own protection. Failure to update makes you vulnerable. You risk losing your information and accounts.</p>



<p>These device and software updates are meant to improve, enhance and fix bugs or loopholes that have been identified.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Use Updated Antivirus and Firewall Software</strong></li></ol>



<p>Just as updating your devices and software, antivirus software needs to be updated constantly.</p>



<p>New viruses are made constantly so as a rule of thumb, update your antivirus!</p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Browse Safely</strong></li></ol>



<p>The internet is invaluable for our daily lives. From learning, keeping up-to-date with news to ordering products such as <a href="https://etech.co.ke/">copiers and printers from Etech</a>. However, you cannot afford to just browse anyhow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many scammer sites on the internet. How do you browse safely?</p>



<ul><li>Adhere to browser warnings. Browsers will often let you know of fake or scam sites.&nbsp;</li><li>Be on the look-out for exaggerated sites and content. Original and genuine content is kinda boring:-) Right?&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Be careful about Ads and hyperlinks</li><li>Again! update your browser and plugins</li><li>Block pop-ups</li><li>Use Ad Block plugins</li><li>Regularly clear your web browser cache and cookies</li><li>Use a VPN if you are using public wifi</li></ul>



<p>With these precautions in mind, it is my belief that you will not let your guard down.</p>



<ol start="6"><li><strong>Use Strong Passwords</strong></li></ol>



<p>Choose strong but easy-to-remember passwords. I know this sounds cliche but it is what it is. Use your unique creativity to create passwords that cannot be easily guessed and that you can remember.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passwords are a weak link when it comes to internet security. Understand that cybercriminals/hackers are always online and can predict a lot. You are born different, use that difference to create unique passwords and a unique life too. Ha!</p>



<p>As for password managers, there is a debate on their safety. So to be safe, have strong and easy-to-remember passwords. Additionally, <a href="https://www.hsbc.com.cn/en-cn/help/online-security/10-ways-to-stay-safe/">regularly change your passwords as advised by HSBC bank</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="7"><li><strong>Download only from Reputable Sites and sources</strong></li></ol>



<p>We download stuff every day. Most of the things we download, we do not even think twice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Who does not want to watch or listen to the newest song before others? Here is where hackers capitalize on. They know you want things for free and instantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the next blog, we will have a look at how to spot legit sites. Because there are so many scam sites out there that we use on a daily basis just because they are free.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Whoever coined the phrase that cheap is expensive knew exactly what he or she meant. Convenience and security can never go hand in hand in the digital space.</p>



<p>Well, there you have it. The internet is a wonderful place to be. However, there are precautions that you have to be conscious about if you want to learn, grow and enjoy life.</p>

<p>If any of you has had the pleasure of using a typewriter then your grandkids must really have a cool grandparent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I bet most of you have never used or even seen a typewriter!&nbsp;</p>



<p>About 30 years ago, typewriters were as common as computers are today. They were a major technological innovation. Like all other technological inventions such as <a href="https://etech.co.ke/product-category/printers/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etech.co.ke/product-category/printers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">printers </a>and computers, typewriters had a large influence on business and office work.</p>



<p><strong>What is a Typewriter?</strong></p>



<p>A typewriter is a mechanical device used to print numbers, alphabets, and characters onto a piece of paper that is attached to a roller. Unlike a computer where you type then print, for a typewriter one just inserts a paper and types on it. When you press the keyboard letters, the typewriter impresses (prints) the letters as you type. The paper comes out as a printed copy.</p>



<p><strong>Invention</strong></p>



<p>It is hard to pinpoint the original creator or inventor of the typewriter. There were many inventors around the world who had tried to come up with a writing machine as early as the 15th century but none was practical.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Latham_Sholes">Christopher Latham Scholes,</a> an American citizen, came up with a functional and reliable typewriter that he patented in 1868. He was into newspapers and printing and in a bid to make his business efficient, he got the urge to come up with a writing machine. Later sold the patent to E. Remington and Sons who made it a success.</p>



<p>Typewriters and printers typically do the same job. The typewriter was invented to replace the pen so as to achieve more writing speed. The printer, on the other hand, was invented to help print multiple copies of a similar document. You can say both machines borrowed from each other. The typewriter specifically influenced a number of things in the business world.</p>

<p><strong>Influence of the Typewriter</strong></p>



<p><strong>QWERTY Keyboard&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Today, it is rare to come across a typewriter. In fact, a majority of the population has no idea what it is. Well, we might think we are so techy with all our smartphones, ipads, and computers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What you do not know is that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSrcoBxVF-Q">QWERTY keyboard</a> arrangement you use daily on your gadgets started with typewriters in the 17th century.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The arrangement was influenced by mechanics at E. Remington and Sons. As a selling point, the mechanics arranged the letters in a way that the letters that make the word ‘TYPEWRITER’ appeared on one row. This way, the salesmen would quickly type the brand name (typewriter) to win clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Female Employment</strong></p>



<p>History is a great thing. It teaches us where we have been and future possibilities. Today, women are spread all across all sectors of the economy and it is a great thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Women in those early years did less strenuous jobs and clerical work was considered feminine. With the invention of the typewriter, secretarial jobs became lucrative for women. One needed the skill of using a typewriter to be employed. Typists were held in high regard and it was viewed as career growth for women.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>



<p>When was the last time you used a pen? Rarely, right? Well, typewriter technology revolutionized communication. Information was written efficiently. Typewriting consumed less time making communication faster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Businesses and governments adapted typewriters in their everyday affairs. Documents were created faster and there was uniformity. Office workers became more productive and efficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Technology has come a long way. The typewriter made an impact and some of it can be seen and felt today. The QWERTY keyboard came with typewriters! Now you know. It also inspired women&#8217;s empowerment. If you have had any experience with a typewriter you&#8217;ve got tales to tell. It is such a baffling and inspiring innovation bearing in mind that it was created in the 19th century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Technology is all around you. Most of the gadgets that you use on a daily basis; at home, in the office, in the car, or in malls have various technological aspects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, digital TVs today have many features that can at times be confusing and challenging. For some of these challenges, you do not always have to contact the manufacturer or your IT guy. You can solve them on your own like a pro!</p>



<p>&nbsp;It is important to understand a few basic IT skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Follow me as I explain some of the basic IT skills that you ought to have.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Using Search Engines</strong></li></ol>



<p>There are billions of websites on the World Wide Web (WWW). These websites contain almost all the information you can ever need in the world. With a smartphone or a laptop, the world is in your hands. Note that there are a number of popular search engines namely <a href="http://google.com/">google</a>, <a href="http://www.bing.com/">bing</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">youtube, </a>and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">duckduckgo</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the questions or problems you have are only a search away. So being able to use search engines correctly is very important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you search for something, be it an error code, a recipe, a location, or a historical fact, you will get search results from various websites. If what you are searching for is not among the websites that show at first, do not worry, instead, try different search terms or try out the search suggestions that come as you type. Search engines also have options such as news, images, videos, books, and maps.</p>



<p>When you have spotted a website that has the information you need from the ‘snippet’ that shows before you open a website, you are good to go. However, you ought to be vigilant because some websites are scams or fake sites that may ask for personal information such as emails and credit card information. In our next blog, we will discuss how to spot scams and fake websites since there are many of them these days.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Know your Cables</strong></li></ol>



<p>There are numerous cables that come with various devices. The cables are used to connect one device with another. Each gadget uses different cable types. It is then crucial to know your cables.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, today, printers and copiers have increased functions, from printing, scanning to mobile print technology. This then translates to more cables. There is no need to always rely on a technician or an IT specialist to help you connect your devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Acquaint yourself with the most common cable types. They include an HDMI cable, ethernet cable, power cable, USB cable, and parallel cable.</p>



<p>Make use of the manuals that come with the devices. All the cable connections are well explained. Understand the connections well and you might even act as an IT guy to a friend who just bought a new device.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://etech.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/usb-type-b-connector-2626033-7fcd72b42dcc4b77b0823f35cc5d13ac-1024x683.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-12394" width="576" height="384"/><figcaption>PHOTO: <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-type-b-connector-2626033" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-type-b-connector-2626033" rel="noreferrer noopener">LifeWire</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<ol start="3"><li><strong>Learn Basic IT Terms</strong></li></ol>



<p>Do not float in IT conversations. You do not have to be an information technology professional to know some of the terminologies used in IT. Imagine calling one of our <a href="https://etech.co.ke/contacts/">Etech technicians</a> to consult on something that you do not know how to explain. “Ati the nini is not niniing!!” Cmon, take a little of your time to learn just a bit. Use your newly acquired search skills to learn more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For copiers, learn <a href="https://www.copierguide.com/help-advice/copier-printer-scanner-terms/">terminologies </a>such as multifunction printer or multifunction device, drum, toner, consumables, images per minute (ipm), pages per minute (ppm), yield, and warm-up time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Be Safe Online</strong></li></ol>



<p>The internet is a great thing to have. It is filled with a lot of valuable information. However, there are many scammers and shady characters too. These <a href="https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/online-safety-basics/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/online-safety-basics/" rel="noreferrer noopener">cybercriminals are tech-savvy</a> and swift.</p>



<p>Being safe does not mean that you stop using the internet. It simply means being vigilant and careful of what you click, share and read.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the basics to staying safe online include:</p>



<ul><li>Using antivirus and antimalware software</li><li>Keeping your devices updated</li><li>Only visit sites that begin with &#8220;https&#8221; rather than &#8220;http&#8221;. The “s” is for secure meaning that your information will be encrypted before being sent to a server.</li><li>Look for the ‘lock’ icon near the search bar. Different browsers place it in different places.</li><li>Make use of your internet browser’s security features.</li><li>Use your common sense. If a website looks strange or is asking for personal information. Run! If a website is asking you to click to win, why would you click on something you had not bet on?</li></ul>



<p>There you have it. Become your own tech guru!</p>

<p>Did you know that printing is ranked the third highest business expense? Other than rent and salaries, printing needs are the most expensive costs for a business.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://acapella.com/7-ways-to-reduce-your-paper-usage/">About 40% of office printed paper is trashed each day.</a> Research also shows that between <a href="https://www.sumnerone.com/blog/5-facts-about-office-printing-paper-and-the-price" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.sumnerone.com/blog/5-facts-about-office-printing-paper-and-the-price" rel="noreferrer noopener">1-3%</a> of yearly revenue goes into printing. Because of lack of software, or a process of recording printing expenses, businesses underestimate printing costs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized" id="printingcost"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://etech.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/True-cost-of-printing-1.gif" alt="True cost of printing" class="wp-image-12292" width="521" height="170" title="Cost of Printing"/></figure>



<p>Source: <a href="https://www.mimeo.com/resources/true-cost-of-printing/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mimeo.com/resources/true-cost-of-printing/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mimeo</a></p>



<p>With this in mind I am sure you are now interested in finding ways to reduce your printing costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://etech.co.ke"><strong>Choose the right Copier or Printer</strong></a></li></ol>



<p>There are many copiers and printers in the market to choose from. Each has its unique features and prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When buying a copier or printer, you should ask a few questions. What features do I need? What will you be printing? What is the volume of the prints you need? What is your budget? Which brands meet your needs and are within your budget?&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are just a few of the many questions you need to answer accurately. Research about a product is not easy but you do not have to worry about that.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://etech.co.ke/contacts/">Contact us</a> at Etech to help out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having the right help will not only help you get a copier or printer that will meet your needs but will also help you get a machine that will help reduce costs. It will only do what you need!</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Buy paper in Bulk</strong></li></ol>



<p>Buying things in bulk treats your pocket fairly.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>It reduces transport to and from the supplier or shop.&nbsp;</li><li>It saves time</li><li>Less packaging, which is also environmentally friendly</li><li>Helps avoid instances of shortages</li></ul>



<p>Printing papers do not go bad, they are papers, not vegetables! Buy in bulk and save money.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Unplug Copier or Printer</strong></li></ol>



<p>This may seem ridiculous, right? No, it is not.</p>



<p>Copiers and printers are machines that use electrical current and circuits. If a circuit breaks then you will need a technician to replace it.</p>



<p>When a copier is left on when it is not in use it is prone to break easily. It not only damages the circuit it also reduces its lifespan.</p>



<p>So, when you are not using your machine, just unplug it. Three seconds of your life only!&nbsp; And this will save you money and business.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Proofread Final Document to be Printed</strong></li></ol>



<p>We are human and we make errors all the time. That is why our teachers were so mad and gave lower marks for minor mistakes.</p>



<p>Printing documents with errors will cost you more.</p>



<p>If you fail to proofread and you go on to print a document with a mistake, you will need to reprint. That is lost paper, time, energy, and electricity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Use a little of your time to proofread and in the end, you will reduce printing costs.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Reuse Waste Paper</strong></li></ol>



<p>Have you ever seen a book with each page having a separate sheet? I bet not.</p>



<p>Hence, utilize every inch of your paper. Use both sides of the paper not unless the documentation you want to print has to be on one page.</p>



<p>When you have documents that are no longer needed, use them as rough papers.</p>



<p>Reusing waste paper is not only cost-effective but also helps to conserve the environment.</p>



<p>Print double-sided! Print only when necessary! Consider having recycling containers!</p>



<ol start="6"><li><strong>Service your Machine Regularly</strong></li></ol>



<p>Do not wait for your copier or printer to break down for you to service it. It does not make sense at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the spirit of reducing printing costs, know some basic copier <a href="https://etech.co.ke/4-common-printer-copier-problems-and-diy-fixes/">care and DIY tips</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before calling Etech technicians, who are always on dial to have a look at your machine, be one with your machine so you have an idea what the problem could be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Failure to frequently service your copier or printer could easily lead to a breakdown. Repairs from breakdown cost you more money.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The ways discussed in this blog are basic ways you can adhere to at the office or at home. There are other technical ways that might require a technician or someone with experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s reduce printing costs! If you need anything clarified <a href="https://etech.co.ke/contacts/">contact </a>Etech for all your needs.&nbsp;</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ricoh printers and copiers are one of the most reputable machines in the print industry. In this post, you will get to understand the reasons why you should consider Ricoh copiers.</p>



<p><strong>History</strong></p>



<p>Ricoh started <a href="https://www.ricoh.com/about/history/1936_1969/">operations in the 1930s</a> in Japan. At first, it was manufacturing sensitized paper. Thereafter, Ricoh began mass-producing cameras which spurred the popularity of cameras.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 1955, Ricoh entered into the business machine industry and it has grown to be among the largest copier manufacturers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Ricoh produces office equipment (copiers and printers), cameras, projectors, Software as a Service (SAAS), and document management software, with operations all around the world.</p>



<p>As you can see, Ricoh has a rich and admirable history. Follow me as we look at why you should consider purchasing Ricoh copiers.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Variety&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>



<p>Ricoh has a wide range of copiers to choose from. Depending on your needs, there is a Ricoh machine for you. The brand has diverse products from desktop printers to feature-rich multipurpose machines that can print, copy, scan, and fax. There is a machine for a home office, a law firm, a school, and a cyber cafe. Visit <a href="https://etech.co.ke/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etech.co.ke/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Etech </a>to have a look at a variety of Ricoh products.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>&nbsp;Cost of Maintenance</strong></li></ol>



<p>While the prices of Ricoh copiers are comparable, the maintenance cost is low. We all want to acquire a gadget that will not later cause headache and heartache, right? Well hear this from me, Ricoh when well maintained and used as per its capabilities will stay for a lifetime.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Feature Rich</strong></li></ol>



<p>With the majority of Ricoh printers, you can configure them to do anything you want, ‘printwise’ that is. The <a href="https://etech.co.ke/product/ricoh-mp-2001/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etech.co.ke/product/ricoh-mp-2001/">Ricoh MP C300</a> for instance performs more tasks in less time. Its features include scanning to a range of destinations, double-sided output, and electronic sorting of copies. These are just a few features that come with Ricoh copiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://etech.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ricoh-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12401"/></figure></div>


<p>PHOTO: <a href="https://etech.co.ke/product/ricoh-aficio-mpc300/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etech.co.ke/product/ricoh-aficio-mpc300/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ricoh Aficio MP C300</a></p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Add-Ons</strong></li></ol>



<p>After you purchase your phone, you go on to purchase a case cover or screen protector. You do not have to purchase a new phone. I hope you are getting where am trying to say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ricoh MFP’s have a variety of accessories to choose from. These include access card readers and power filters. Therefore, after you have purchased your Ricoh copier and need an upgrade, talk to <a href="https://etech.co.ke/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etech.co.ke/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Etech </a>to see if there is an accessory that can help with the upgrade.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Sustainability</strong></li></ol>



<p>Environmental degradation is happening at an alarming rate. Ricoh has been at the forefront of <a href="https://www.ricoh.com/sustainability/environment/">sustainable environmental management</a>. The company has won a number of accolades over the years due to its commitment to sustainability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As much as the protection of the ecosystem starts with us and where we live, purchasing products that are made to be environmentally friendly is a plus and a responsibility for consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clearly, there is a wide array of Ricoh copiers to choose from. Finding the right printer for your needs is at best challenging. At Etech we have done the heavy lifting for you. <a href="https://etech.co.ke/contacts/">Contact us</a> so we can guide you in choosing the right Ricoh copier or printer for you.</p>

<p>2021 is finally over and 2022 is here! 2021 has surely been a tough one for almost all of us. The pandemic, slow business, lost jobs, lost opportunities, and some broken relationships. What&#8217;s even worse is that we are in a new year and January/holiday Blues have kicked in.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://etech.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ezgif.com-gif-maker7.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12383" width="337" height="466"/></figure></div>


<p>This is a time in our lives where we always hear ‘happy new year’ greetings all around. Or is the &#8216;happy new year’ cliche a way of cheering us up?</p>



<p>January Blues is an actual condition. It is a form of situational depression as <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-time-cure/201412/holiday-blues-vs-seasonal-affective-disorder" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-time-cure/201412/holiday-blues-vs-seasonal-affective-disorder">explained by Rosemary Sword,</a> a therapist. It is brought about by the emotional shift from the holiday mood to the normal work or school routine. We usually feel some kind of anxiety and depression.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Causes of January/holiday Blues</strong></p>



<ul><li>The holiday season is finally over and it is time to go back to our normal lifes.&nbsp;</li><li>Family and friends are not around. The next time you hope to reconnect with them again is during the holidays again!</li><li>Some of us drank and ate like it was the end of the world. While others have gained weight, others are battling withdrawal symptoms from over indulgence in booze.</li><li>Debts might have increased as you needed to have a time of your life that comes once a year.</li><li>Projects or assignments that were meant to be done over the long holiday are probably not started or finished.</li><li>It is time to set new year resolutions that seem more like a fairy tale.</li></ul>



<p>Do not worry too much, January Blues happen even to the best of humans. What&#8217;s important is to understand that it is a phase of life that has to take its course. It may last days or even weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, here is a guide to help you deal with January Blues.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Practice Mindfulness&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>



<p>Mindfulness is a state of mind where you are able to tell exactly what you are feeling and sensing without being hard on yourself. This is a great way to put your mind at ease and live for the moment. You will be able to stop or block negative thoughts and daydreaming.</p>



<p>No matter how determined we may be to work on something, our minds often veer off. When you are able to put your mind and energy on a task, anxiety about the future and thoughts of the past will have no space.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Connect with Nature</strong></li></ol>



<p>Humans are one with nature. Take a walk and be conscious of what nature has to offer. Watch a river flow, listen to birds chirping, watch the sunset or listen to trees whispering. According to Edward Abbey “<a href="https://www.abbeyweb.net/abbey.html">Wilderness is not a luxury but necessity of the human spirit</a>”.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Exercise</strong></li></ol>



<p>There is no doubt that exercise is a solution to feeling lull/down. Exercise not only reduces your risk of getting major illnesses such as diabetes or heart complications, but it also helps improve your mood, energy, self-esteem, and sleep quality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Go on exercise for at least 30 minutes, and the change will be evident.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Set Attainable and Realistic Goals</strong></li></ol>



<p>This is not the time to cloud your mind with mega projects. Ease up and set actionable goals. Do not overwhelm your mind, it is already in distress from the holiday buzz. Step by Step! and you will get there. If you had planned to purchase a copier or printer, for instance, go for it,&nbsp; <a href="https://etech.co.ke/">Etech Office Solutions</a> is a great place to get exactly what you need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s beat these January Blues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Working from home can be difficult especially during the holiday season. There are countless potential disruptions. It is also easy to feel lonely being the only one working amidst the chaos at home. This shouldn’t be the case.</p>



<p>Christmas is here. I bet there are some of you who have projects that are due in January. Oh unto you! January is about a week from now. I know how it feels working from home and it&#8217;s the holiday. Kids are out screaming their lungs out, cousins, uncles and aunts are reminiscing the good old days. You do not have to feel sorry for yourself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Follow me as I breakdown the easy tips that will ensure you finalize that project you are dreading.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://etech.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kari-shea-wK3nMle_l38-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12328" width="489" height="326"/></figure>



<p>Source: <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/wK3nMle_l38" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://unsplash.com/photos/wK3nMle_l38" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unsplash</a></p>



<p>&nbsp;Working from home ought to be enjoyable, elicit better productivity and harness potential.</p>



<p>How do you do this?&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li><strong>Set up a Workspace or home office</strong></li></ol>



<p>Having a designated space for all work related activities will help you to maintain discipline and focus. Instead of checking and replying to mails, texts or calls while watching TV, create a workspace.</p>



<p>In the last blog, we looked at <a href="https://etech.co.ke/10-must-have-home-office-equipments/">10 Must-have Home Office Equipment</a>. Make use of this to come up with a safe space for your work and sanity.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Set strict Office Space rules</strong></li></ol>



<p>When you are done setting up your workspace, set ground rules that are to be followed by all including you. If there are kids around, let it be clear to them that if they want to continue to enjoy your sweat, they need to stay away from the workspace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For adults, make sure they understand your schedule and probably negotiate times when you can talk, share equipment or participate in a chore.</p>



<p>Setting boundaries is a great way of ensuring that your schedule will flow more efficiently.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Time Management</strong></li></ol>



<p>After you have set up your workspace and the rules, how you manage the time you have is what will determine whether you will finish your work on time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Manage your time based on your productivity. Figure out the time of day when you are most productive and when you are likely to be less productive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you have figured out your ‘productivity clock’, make use of time-tracking apps such as <a href="https://www.callpesa.com/">callpesa</a> or <a href="https://pomofocus.io/">pomofocus</a>. These automatic time-tracking apps help a lot to better manage time and come up with a routine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Routines are as powerful as clocks. Existing habits happen subconsciously and come naturally. Hence limiting room for slacking.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Step Outside for Breaks</strong></li></ol>



<p>In the normal office schedule, there are breaks. Breaks for tea, lunch and stretching. They are not designed just for eating or drinking. They are strategically allocated for a chance to disconnect from work and rejuvenate the mind and body.</p>



<p>Move away from your computer, phone and from the workspace. Loosen up and get time to breathe fresh air, listen to the birds chirping, tease the kids and joke around with your family. This will release tension and burnout. Take the breaks in their entirety. If it is lunch time, take your time and enjoy that home-cooked meal.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>These are just basic guidelines. Be creative! You know yourself better. However, there are some basics that have to be followed if you are to finalise that project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do not be too hard on yourself, it is the holiday. When you drift away do not be too disappointed with yourself. Instead, positively ask yourself if you were at the office would you do the same thing? Then humbly get back to work. Stay positive, your perspective is your greatest power.</p>

<p>The pandemic has proved to us that working from home is here to stay. We all have watched video meetings of people sleeping in the middle of conference calls or getting interrupted by a child or a partner ‘inappropriately’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However tricky it may seem, working from home can increase productivity and at the same time be enjoyable. All you need is the focus, obviously! and the right home office equipment.</p>



<p>We are in the holiday season and I believe that most of you already have a home office or are in the process of setting up. This is where I come in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Determining which equipment is important can be a tough task. You may either underestimate or overestimate. Don’t worry, I got you!</p>

<p>Here is a list of must-have home office equipment.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li><strong>Computer or Laptop</strong></li></ol>



<p>A computer or a laptop? This will depend on the nature of your work. A laptop is better. Its mobility is key especially for you who needs to meet clients in the field or use it at the office. If you need to move around the house to find a comfortable position after sitting for too long on your office chair, a laptop gives you that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Internet</strong></li></ol>



<p>Who doesn’t need the internet these days ‘for work’? Fast and reliable internet is a must-have for a home office. Almost everything is virtual. From meetings, file storage to preparation of documents. And a bit of social media. Haha..</p>



<p></p>

<ol start="3"><li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Desk and Chair</strong></li></ol>



<p>You have the computer and internet, where are you going to work from? An office desk is part of the office. There are a variety of desks of different shapes, sizes, and prices. Shop for one that fits your style and budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An office chair plays a great role in determining your productivity and love for your home office. Often you see office equipment advertisements with the word ergonomics. It basically means that the equipment fits your kind of comfort. Your health is a priority. There is no need to work, work, work, and later in life suffer from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/office-ergonomics/art-20046169">back and neck pain</a>. When shopping for one, make sure to test so that you can be assured of comfort and ergonomics.&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="4"><li><strong>Monitor</strong></li></ol>



<p>A desktop computer obviously comes with a monitor. For a laptop, it is even more fun when connected to a monitor. It is great for better planning of work as well as readjusting positions. You may need more than one based on the work you do.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://etech.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop-monitor.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12307"/></figure>

<p></p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Printer or copier </strong>&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Etech will take care of this. A <a href="https://etech.co.ke/product-category/printers/">printer </a>or <a href="https://etech.co.ke/product-category/copiers/">copier </a>might seem unnecessary for a home office till you need to print something and remember me. There are a variety of desktop copiers and printers that are less expensive and have the ability to scan, print, and copy. <a href="https://etech.co.ke/">Etech </a>has got your back on this one.</p>



<ol start="6"><li><strong>Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)</strong></li></ol>



<p>Let&#8217;s face it, we live in Kenya. As much as Daima mimi ni Mkenya, electricity can at times be unpredictable. Invest in a UPS to ensure that you are not caught flat-footed.</p>



<ol start="7"><li><strong>Quality Headphones or Earphones</strong></li></ol>



<p>If you want to concentrate on your work being at home, noise-canceling earphones or headphones are a must-have. You are at home, not at the office. The kids, a larger-than-life roommate, a partner who needs your attention 24/7 or an entitled visiting relative all will effectively make sure no work will be done yet they need to eat.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="8"><li><strong>Coffee Mug and Water Bottle</strong></li></ol>



<p>I like this one. Mwanzo look for classy ones that will help to calm and cool you down and make your ‘office’ look elegant. You do not also need to keep going to the kitchen. Concentration is key buaana.</p>



<ol start="9"><li><strong>Notebook and Pen</strong></li></ol>



<p>You will often need to note something down or even draw something as you brainstorm or calm your nerves. A notebook can even be your mini diary. Despite the digital calendars, notebooks come in handy when <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/554844/7-brilliant-reasons-carry-notebook-you">noting down ideas that come up as you work</a>. As for a pen, I am sure we all have that unique pen that we never want to share. Look for a pen that will be synonymous with your office. One that can even ‘talk on your behalf.&#8221;</p>



<ol start="10"><li><strong>File Cabinet</strong></li></ol>



<p>Work files are for work. I remember once my little sister went into my old man&#8217;s office, took a pen, and started scribbling all over his diary. You know what later happened. Have a cabinet where you can organize your documents and keep them safe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that we have looked at the rich history of printing, let us now have a look at the future and opportunities in the printing industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gone are the days when you had to go to government offices to renew driving licenses, good conduct certificates, and insurance. Additionally, CBC is here with us na haitaki hasira.</p>



<p>Almost all government and business services are online. What does this mean? More people are now printing their documents locally, hapo uko. In offices and cyber shops.</p>



<p>Opportunities are available for you that owns a print business or even a <a href="https://etech.co.ke/product-category/printers/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etech.co.ke/product-category/printers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">printer </a>at home.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li><strong>&nbsp;CBC</strong></li></ol>



<p>CBC has come with all manner of demands. My 7-year-old nephew always has something to print over the weekends. He is now friends with Jonte the cyber guy from our hood. His weekends are not weekends if he does not go to Jontes’.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://etech.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CBC-Meme.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12271" width="448" height="375"/></figure>



<p></p>



<p>A parent wishes for his/her kids to prosper and you who is into printing or have a printer at home, help these kids meet the demands of our new education system.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Government Services</strong></li></ol>



<p>Most of the government services are now online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From driving license renewal, business licenses, insurance stickers to good conduct certificates. Just to name a few.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take advantage of these opportunities to make money.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Branding</strong></li></ol>



<p>Today, branding is big business. Competition out here is real. Companies are aggressively having branding campaigns so as to stand out and beat the competition.</p>



<p>Use this opportunity to help businesses in branding. </p>



<p>Flyers, brochures, business cards, posters, roll-up banners, stickers, product labels, etc. These are just a number of examples.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>2022 Election</strong></li></ol>



<p>The election is a few months away. The election heat is rising daily. Politicians from MCAs, MPs, Senators, governors to presidential candidates are now rushing to brand themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The streets are now colored with all manner of posters and banners. Of course, it will be annoying since our walls, gates, electricity poles will be filled with ‘promises’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But pause, that&#8217;s a huge opportunity that you should take advantage of like yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Events and Ceremonies</strong></li></ol>



<p>Covid restrictions have been eased. We hope Covid goes for good. Amen!</p>



<p>It is a good thing as events and ceremonies are back! This means that there is a demand for gift cards, invitation cards, and eulogies. To mention but a few. Tufanye kazi jamani.</p>



<ol start="6"><li><strong>People are back to the Office</strong></li></ol>



<p>Offices are now functioning ‘almost normally’. As a kenyan ofisi ni ofisi like it is an office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A diary, a calendar, a notebook have always been associated with offices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is where your money is. Our brothers and sisters working in offices need these services. Cheza kiwewe!! Even if tech may try to take away or maybe has already taken the power of having a calendar and a diary, don’t you feel organized having an actual calendar or diary on your desk?</p>



<p>This online craze is confusing for us all. Embrace it but take advantage of the power printed calendars or diaries have. They are still a popular way for promoting companies. For example, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/brandspirit/promotional-calendars/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.pinterest.com/brandspirit/promotional-calendars/" rel="noreferrer noopener">customerzied calendars</a> are a great way for companies to gift their clients.</p>



<p>Last but not least, online shops that deliver items use branded packages. Here is yet another opportunity in the printing industry.</p>



<p>So printers will continue to ‘have work to do’. Just be creative and conscious of the trends in the market. The campaign season is here and chances to make money with your <a href="https://etech.co.ke/product-category/printers/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etech.co.ke/product-category/printers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">printer </a>or <a href="https://etech.co.ke/product-category/copiers/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etech.co.ke/product-category/copiers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">copier </a>are waiting for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other than a mobile phone, a printer is an important office equipment. In almost all offices you visit, you will find a printer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The uphill task for you is finding the right printer for your needs. This should, however, not worry you, Etech Office Solutions is a leader in printing needs and will walk with you as you find the right copier or printer for you. Etech understands that choosing the best printer for you is not easy with lots of conflicting advise online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Be rest assured that Etech will listen, understand and guide you.&nbsp;</p>
